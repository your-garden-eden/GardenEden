Whether your specific delivery address can be delivered to will be **automatically checked in the checkout area** after you have entered your address. If delivery to your postcode is not possible, you will be informed accordingly and unfortunately you will not be able to complete the order for this address. A list of all excluded postcodes is not publicly available; the check is carried out automatically in the system.
## 2. Shipping costs
Shipping costs vary depending on the destination country and the products ordered.
* For most countries we ship to (see list above), **standard shipping is free**.
* An exception is shipping to **Australia**:
* Shipping is **free** for delivery addresses in the following metropolitan areas: Sydney Metropolitan, Melbourne Metropolitan, Brisbane, and Gold Coast.
    * For all **other** delivery addresses in Australia, shipping costs are calculated based on the weight (the logistical weight of the product) and your postal code.
* **Please note:** For delivery addresses in certain remote postal code areas in Australia, **additional shipping costs** may apply in addition to the standard shipping costs.
* The **exact shipping costs** for your entire order (including any applicable taxes and possible additional costs for remote areas) will be clearly displayed during the checkout process after you have entered your delivery address and before you complete your order. You will see the final price before you place your binding order.
* For orders with multiple products, the shipping costs for each product will be calculated separately and added to the total shipping price of the order. The shipping costs displayed include the applicable tax.
## 3. Delivery times
The delivery time consists of the **processing time/shipping time** (dispatch time) by vidaXL and the subsequent **transport time** by the shipping service provider. Please note that all delivery times are **estimates** and may vary.
*  **Processing time:** The time required by vidaXL to process and ship your order (dispatch time) is usually between **1 and 8 business days**, depending on the country and item.
*  **Total delivery time:
*  For many countries, such as Germany (approx. 3 business days), Austria (approx. 2 business days), Belgium (approx. 4 working days), France (approx. 4 working days), Netherlands (approx. 4 working days), Poland (approx. 3 working days), the estimated total delivery time (including processing and transport) after receipt of the order is usually between **2 and 7 working days**.
    * For other countries for which vidaXL does not explicitly state a total delivery time in the data available to us (e.g. Switzerland, Spain, Finland, Greece, UK, etc.), the delivery time consists of the above-mentioned processing time plus the transport time of the respective carrier. The total delivery time may vary and cannot be determined in advance.
    *  **Special cases:** For certain delivery destinations, the delivery time may be significantly longer (e.g., shipping to the US from the Netherlands with an estimated 60 business days).
*  **Pallet deliveries: For items shipped on pallets by a freight forwarder, the processing time until shipment by vidaXL is up to **20 business days**. The total delivery time for pallet deliveries is usually significantly longer than for parcel deliveries and will be communicated to you separately or displayed during the ordering process.
As shipping is handled directly by vidaXL, we have no direct influence on the exact transport times or possible delays caused by the carrier or external circumstances.
## 4. Shipping process, carrier, and tracking
Shipping is carried out directly from the vidaXL warehouses. Depending on the destination country and type of product (parcel or pallet), vidaXL works with various national and international shipping service providers, such as DPD, GLS, Hermes, UPS, FedEx (from April 18, 2025 in the US, phased in), Raben, Bpost, SEUR, and many more. You will find out which carrier is responsible for your specific shipment in the shipping confirmation.
After your order has been processed by vidaXL, you will receive a shipping confirmation from us, which usually includes a tracking number (tracking ID) if available for your shipment. You can use this number to track the status of your delivery on the website of the responsible shipping service provider. Please note that it may take a few hours for the tracking information to become available.
## 5. Partial deliveries
Please note that if you order multiple items, they may be shipped in **separate packages**. This is because the items may be shipped from different vidaXL warehouses or have different packaging requirements. The deliveries may therefore arrive at different times. You will not incur any additional shipping costs.
## 6. Important shipping information
*  **Direct shipping by vidaXL:** Your order will be picked, packed, and shipped entirely by our partner vidaXL.
*  **Appointment for pallet deliveries:** For freight shipments (pallet deliveries), the contracted carrier will contact you directly to arrange a delivery date. Please ensure that the telephone number provided when placing your order is correct and that you can be reached at this number.
*  **No direct influence on transport: We have no direct influence on the transport route or possible delays caused by the shipping service provider or external circumstances.
*  **Correct and valid delivery address: Please ensure that your delivery address is complete and correct. This also means that the address must not contain any special characters or symbols that could be considered invalid by our logistics partner vidaXL's system and blocked. Addresses containing such blocked phrases or other errors may result in delivery problems, delays, or your order not being processed and shipped. Please check your address carefully.
*  **Delivery to packing stations/post offices:** Delivery to packing stations or post offices is generally not possible via vidaXL. Delivery will be made to the specified home address.
