# Right of withdrawal & returns
We offer a **30-day return policy**. This means that you have 30 days after receiving your item to request a return.
To be eligible for a return, the item must be in the same condition you received it: unworn, unused, with tags attached, and in its original packaging. You will also need the receipt or other proof of purchase.
## Initiating a return
To initiate a return, you can contact us at [info@Your-Garden-Eden.de](mailto:info@Your-Garden-Eden.de). Please note that returns must be sent back to the **shipper** (usually our logistics partner vidaXL, see shipping conditions).
If your return is accepted, you will receive a return label from us as well as instructions on how and where to send the package. Items that are returned to us without a return request will not be accepted.
If you have any questions about returns, you can contact us at any time at [info@Your-Garden-Eden.de](mailto:info@Your-Garden-Eden.de).
## Damage and problems
Please check your order **upon receipt** and contact us immediately if the item is defective or damaged or if you have received the wrong item so that we can evaluate and resolve the problem.
## Exceptions / Items not eligible for return
Certain items cannot be returned, e.g.:
* Perishable goods (e.g. food, flowers or plants)
* Custom-made items (e.g. special orders or personalized items)
* Personal care products (e.g. beauty products)
We also do not accept returns of hazardous materials, flammable liquids, or gases. Please contact us if you have any questions or concerns about a specific item.
Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns of **sale items** or **gift cards**.
## Exchanges
Returning the item you received is the fastest way to get the item you want. If the return is accepted, you can purchase the new item in a separate purchase. Direct exchanges are generally not possible.
## European Union – Statutory 14-day withdrawal period
Notwithstanding our extended 30-day return policy, as a consumer in the European Union, you have the legal right to cancel your order within **14 days** of receiving the goods without giving any reason. As described above, the item must be in the same condition in which you received it (unworn, unused, with labels, original packaging) in order to be returned. You will also need proof of purchase.
## Refunds
We will notify you once we have received and inspected your return and let you know whether or not the refund has been approved.
If approved, you will receive an automatic refund to your original payment method within **10 business days**, **minus a fixed return fee of €8.90**.
Please keep in mind that it may take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund. If more than 15 business days have passed since we approved your return, please contact us at [info@Your-Garden-Eden.de](mailto:info@Your-Garden-Eden.de).
